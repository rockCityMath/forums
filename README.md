# Installation / Use
- clone the project
- run "npm install" in both the front and backend folder
- to start the frontend: navigate to the forums-front folder and run "ng serve"
- to start the backend: navigate to the forums-back folder and run "nodemon index.js" 
- You must set up a mongoDB database and enter the information in the forums-back/db/index.js

* nodemon is preferred at the moment as certain errors can crash the regular node server
